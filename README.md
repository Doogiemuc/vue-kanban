# vue-kanban

Just a small hacking project for a Kanban Board.

The goal of this project is to provide a personal Kanban Board that can run inside a browser.
Ideally it can even run offline without any internet connection.
The data of the cards on the board is stored in the browser DB. (Yes modern browsers do have a DB built in :-)
The frontend is implemented with (VueJS)[https://vuejs.org/]
